# RUNNER-LESSONS — the shared defect memory (every build session reads AND feeds this)

Created 2026-08-06 after Cameron: "it will probably still suck and make mistakes
becasue your not doing anythign for making it do it better learning from
previous mistakes or using previously made pictures."

**The law:** before Light QC on any row, read every pattern below and check the
frames against them. When you find a defect class NOT listed here — even one
you rerolled successfully — ADD it as one line before your session ends and
commit it. This file is how one session's $0.13 mistake stops being every
session's $0.13 mistake. Keep entries deduped and one line each.

## FLEET / COLLISION — read this at CLAIM time (step 1), before you pick a row

- **Art lives in `<build>/assets/*.jpeg`, NOT `<build>/frames/*.png`.** The
  `frames/` dir is essentially always empty. Judging "this claimed row crashed"
  by an empty `frames/` is WRONG and is what made 3+ lanes all pile onto row 45
  and burn redundant Gemini money (2026-08-06). Count `assets/*.jpeg` instead.
- **A `RUNNING` + `A-auto` row is NOT automatically stranded.** The autopilot
  runs up to 6 parallel lanes and every lane signs claims `A-auto`, so that
  signature CANNOT tell a live sibling from a crashed self. Before resuming any
  `RUNNING`/`A-auto` row, run `ps aux | grep v2_gen_api | grep -v grep`: if a
  `v2_gen_api.py <that-build>` process is alive, or its `assets/` is still
  growing, a LIVE sibling owns it — do NOT touch it, take the next clean row.
  Only resume a `RUNNING` row when NO sibling gen is live (mirror
  `autopilot.sh` next_stranded, which resumes only when LIVE==0).
- **Claim uniquely so the next lane can tell:** put asset count + "LIVE" in the
  AUTHOR-BOARD claim cell of a row you are actively building, and mark it BUILT
  the instant it ships so `next_ready` (state must be AUTHORED) skips it.
- **Never `git add -A` while siblings generate** — you will sweep another
  lane's in-flight `assets/` and `api-spend.jsonl` into your commit. Add only
  your row's paths + the boards/SESSION-LOG explicitly. Pull with
  `--rebase --autostash`.

## Known defect patterns (check every frame)

- **Modern objects sneak in**: hurricane/kerosene lamps (b41 war tent), modern
  chairs (b41), school slates chalked with ARABIC NUMERALS (b41 — period
  writing only, or blank), wristwatches, buttons, stitched tailoring.
- **Wrong aspect inside the canvas**: a 16:9 image letterboxed inside the 9:16
  frame (b41) — reroll on sight, never crop-rescue.
- **Second cream-robed figure**: ONLY Jesus wears cream; any other cream robe
  fails the frame.
- **Lens-staring**: any figure looking into the camera fails.
- **Headless/extra-limbed figures** (b16 headless at b07): count heads, arms,
  legs at full resolution, especially in crowds.
- **Beards appear/disappear/recolor between frames** (rubric lesson 13 — rows
  9/62/91/102): run the beard-only pass per person.
- **Giant/shrunken figures** (rubric lesson 14 — rows 56/69/107/112): height-
  check every multi-figure frame against a shared reference; Jesus is
  ordinary-sized, children stay child-sized.
- **Empty sandals with toes / lamps burning off the wick** (b17): objects obey
  physics; flames sit ON wicks only.
- **Fair-haired / blue-eyed drift on locked cast** (BUILDER in a FIX-WAVE
  note): locks say dark hair/eyes — check every named person against their
  lock even when the face "looks fine".
- **PLATE frames propagate their defects** (b41 lamp was IN the plate): QC the
  plate/anchor frame FIRST and hardest — every later beat of that place
  inherits its mistakes.
- **Place wired as a person** (WARTENT queued as a portrait, b41 session): a
  place must never carry a character lock.
- **Wrong story on the board** (row 44 two-debtors vs the QUEUE's Pentecost
  swap): cross-check the row against media-production/QUEUE.md BEFORE spending.

## Reuse before regenerate (Cameron's core order — rubric lesson 11 + COST LAW)

- Plates: `v2_stash.py --wire` before generating; promote-first for new places.
- **After every ship: run `python3 media-production-v2/v2_stash.py --scan` and
  commit STASH-INDEX.json** so the row's passing stills instantly become
  reusable plates for every later row. A place generated twice because the
  index was stale is a COST LAW violation.
- Portraits/cast sheets are reused across rows automatically — never re-pay
  for a face that has a sheet.
