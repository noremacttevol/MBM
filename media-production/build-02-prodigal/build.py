"""Assemble Story Video #2 — The Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32).
Hybrid storybook format per PRODUCTION-BIBLE.md: painted stills with Ken Burns
drift + 1 animated money-moment clip (s05 THE FATHER RUNS), narration
(edge-tts), serif captions, KJV red-letter line, closing question card on
cream #F7F2E9.

SPEAKER-LAW rebuild (see media-production/SPEAKER-LAW.md). Converted from the old
template B: the 7-tuple SEGMENTS with hardcoded durations and a per-beat
`caption_style` is gone. Who is speaking is declared ONCE in make_narration.py and
decides BOTH the narration voice and the caption colour. Beat durations are derived
from the narration audio (LEAD + spoken + gap), never hand-set, and the video ends
TAIL seconds after the last spoken word.

The caption look, the Ken Burns maths, the audio mix, the loudness pass and the
size ladder are unchanged.

Built via the section 4b RIGHT-FIRST-TIME PRE-FLIGHT (see PREFLIGHT.md) —
plan checked on paper before any generation.

Two-Voice Law: narrator modern American; Jesus voice speaks ONLY exact KJV
(Luke 15:24 at the feast; Luke 15:31-32 to the older brother — the TRUE last
story words).

2026-07-09: Cameron caught that the first cut told only HALF the parable —
it ended at the feast and omitted the older brother (Luke 15:25-32), the half
aimed at the religious men the story answers. Second half added: the brother
outside, the father's second going-out, the complaint, and the father's
answer as the closing KJV. Full-Story check added to Bible section 4b.

Opens with the "why Jesus told it" bookend (pattern Cameron approved on #8/#6).
Closing card is read aloud (Readable-Card Law).

Output: 1080x1920 H.264, <25MB.
